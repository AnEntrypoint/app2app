Apptoapp is an application that transforms OpenAI prompts from one app to another. It is designed to facilitate the process of using OpenAI's GPT-3 model across different applications. With apptoapp, you can easily generate prompts and get responses from the model, making it a valuable tool for developers and AI enthusiasts.

## Installation

Before you can run apptoapp, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can install apptoapp globally using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g apptoapp
```

You can also run it anywhere with npx:

````bash
npx apptoapp your prompt here

## Usage

Before you start using apptoapp, you need to set up a .env file in your project root with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
````

Once you have that set up, you can use apptoapp by running the following command:

```bash
npx apptoapp "your prompt here"
```

This will send your prompt to the OpenAI API and return the response.
