this program is an automated tool that edits other projects

it is a command line tool that uses llm to edit files in the local directory, and iterate on testing the code

write unit tests to discover and fix any problem you're dealing with, dont fix anything without unit testing

when you are sure that there are files that you can confirm to be old left-behind unused code, they can be deleted using the cli

always make 100% sure that none of the tests will get stuck, you have to apply strategies to avoid that
