this program is an automated tool that edits other projects

it is a command line tool that uses llm to edit files in the local directory, and iterate on testing the code

make sure all unit tests time out after 10 seconds

always iterate, when iterating, run: npm run lint; npm run test:e2e; npm run build

use unit tests to discover and fix any problem you're dealing with, dont fix anythign without unit testing

when you are sure that there are files that you can confirm to be old left-behind unused code, they can be deleted
