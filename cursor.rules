this project is an auto programmer, its a CLI tool that edits other project, we dont want to improve the test project its editing under test/ we want to improve its ability to edit projects, and test/ is just an example that we are testing with

the source code you have to edit is in src, not test

do not edit test/ use the program in src to edit test/, same goes for cli commands like npm installs etc, the program should make all changes

do not edit any files in the test directory yourself, the program in src is supposed to edit it, changes to the test/ folder happens by running the app

to run this cd to ./test and call ../index.js make this a comprehensive artist portfolio website

keep iterating, dont stop, keep going and do refactoring, cleanups, note taking (NOTES.txt) when you're documentation

keep iterating until this auto programmer fully realises the users instructions

every time code changes have been made, try to run the application again to verify that the changes are correct and speculate on what further to change in NOTES.txt

make sure the app doesnt get stuck on any of its steps when testing

keep a NOTES.txt file to document what you've done and what you're doing

keep a CHANGELOG.txt file to document what you've done and what you're doing

keep a TODO.txt file to document what you're doing and what you're going to do

always check TODO.txt and remove everything that has been done and tested already when placing the data into CHANGELOG.txt

I want this auto programmer to be able to tranform the project in the test/ directory into a artist portfolio website, only edit the code in src/ to make that happen
