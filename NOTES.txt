Initial changes:
1. Added a check in index.js to ensure the user is in the ./test directory before running the script.
2. Added a check in transform.js to ensure the instruction is provided before starting the cycle.
3. Updated package.json to include necessary scripts and dependencies.
4. Created a basic structure for the portfolio website in index.js.
5. Created styles.css for basic styling.
6. Updated index.js to call cycleTasks from transform.js with a default test URL and instruction.

Next steps:
1. Verify that the changes are correct by running the application.
2. Add more sections to the portfolio website (e.g., About, Projects, Contact).
3. Implement a way to add projects dynamically.
4. Speculate on what further changes can be made to better realize the user's instructions.
5. Ensure the application does not get stuck on any of its steps when testing.
