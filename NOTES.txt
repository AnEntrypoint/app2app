Initial changes:
1. Added a check in index.js to ensure the user is in the ./test directory before running the script.
2. Added a check in transform.js to ensure the instruction is provided before starting the cycle.

Next steps:
1. Verify that the changes are correct by running the application.
2. Speculate on what further changes can be made to better realise the user's instructions.
