Initial changes:
1. Added a check in index.js to ensure the user is in the ./test directory before running the script.
2. Added a check in transform.js to ensure the instruction is provided before starting the cycle.
3. Updated package.json to include necessary scripts and dependencies.
4. Created a basic structure for the portfolio website in index.js.
5. Created styles.css for basic styling.
6. Updated index.js to call cycleTasks from transform.js with a default test URL and instruction.
7. Created cli.js to handle command-line arguments and start the cycle.

RETRY MECHANISM IMPLEMENTATION:
- Exponential backoff with jitter helps prevent thundering herd problem
- Configurable retry conditions allow for flexible error handling
- Logging provides visibility into retry attempts and failures
- Tests cover all major retry scenarios

OBSERVATIONS:
- Need to consider implementing rate limiting next
- Should add metrics collection for retry attempts
- Consider adding circuit breaker pattern
- May need to adjust default retry parameters based on usage patterns

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
2. Add metrics collection for monitoring retry patterns
3. Consider implementing circuit breaker for failing dependencies
4. Add performance monitoring for API calls

RATE LIMITER IMPLEMENTATION:
- Token bucket algorithm provides smooth rate limiting
- Queue system handles request bursts gracefully
- Automatic token refill prevents resource exhaustion
- Timeout mechanism prevents queue from growing indefinitely
- Tests verify all critical functionality

OBSERVATIONS:
- Rate limiter could be extended to support multiple buckets
- Consider adding metrics for queue length and wait times
- May need to adjust timeout values based on real-world usage
- Could add priority queue for important requests

NEXT STEPS:
1. Add metrics collection for monitoring
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern
3. Add caching layer for API responses
4. Add support for multiple AI providers

CACHE IMPLEMENTATION:
- TTL-based caching with automatic expiration
- Size-based eviction with LRU-like behavior
- Comprehensive metrics tracking
- Efficient key generation for complex objects
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking

OBSERVATIONS:
- Cache hit rates should be monitored in production
- May need to adjust TTL values based on data freshness requirements
- Consider adding cache warming mechanism
- Could implement distributed caching for scaling

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern
2. Add support for multiple AI providers
3. Add cache warming mechanism
4. Consider distributed caching options
